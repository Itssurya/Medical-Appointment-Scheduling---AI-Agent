   - **Provider**: Twilio API for SMS delivery
   - **Features**: Appointment confirmations, reminder notifications
   - **Integration**: Automated SMS sending with phone number validation

### Key Technical Decisions

#### 1. State Management Architecture

**Decision**: Centralized state management with AppointmentState class
**Rationale**: 
- Maintains conversation context across agents
- Enables complex multi-step workflows
- Provides audit trail for debugging

**Implementation**:
```python
class AppointmentState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.patient_info = {}
        self.appointment_details = {}
        self.insurance_info = {}
        self.current_step = "greeting"
        self.conversation_history = []
```

#### 2. Patient Classification Logic

**Decision**: Duration-based classification (60min new, 30min returning)
**Rationale**:
- Simple and effective business rule
- Easy to implement and maintain
- Clear differentiation for scheduling

**Implementation**:
```python
duration = NEW_PATIENT_DURATION if is_new_patient else RETURNING_PATIENT_DURATION
```

#### 3. Database Design

**Decision**: SQLite with normalized schema
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and portable
- Sufficient for MVP requirements
- Easy to migrate to PostgreSQL later

**Schema Design**:
- `patients`: Patient demographics and contact info
- `appointments`: Appointment details and status
- `doctor_schedules`: Availability and booking slots
- `reminders`: Automated reminder tracking
- `forms`: Intake form distribution tracking

#### 4. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
**Rationale**:
- Maintains user experience during failures
- Provides clear feedback for troubleshooting
- Enables system recovery

**Implementation**:
- Try-catch blocks around critical operations
- Fallback mechanisms for service failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging

### Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Natural Language Processing for Patient Data Extraction

**Problem**: Extracting structured data from unstructured patient input
**Solution**: 
- Regex-based pattern matching for common formats
- LLM-powered information extraction
- Fallback prompts for missing information

**Implementation**:
```python
def _extract_patient_info(self, user_input: str, state: AppointmentState):
    # Name extraction
    name_pattern = r"my name is (\w+)\s+(\w+)"
    name_match = re.search(name_pattern, user_input.lower())
    
    # Date of birth extraction
    dob_patterns = [r"(\d{1,2})[\/\-](\d{1,2})[\/\-](\d{4})"]
    # ... additional patterns
```

#### Challenge 2: Real-time Calendar Availability Management

**Problem**: Managing appointment slots and preventing double-booking
**Solution**:
- Database-level locking for slot booking
- Atomic transactions for appointment creation
- Real-time availability checking

**Implementation**:
```python
def book_appointment(self, patient_id: str, doctor_name: str, 
                    appointment_date: str, start_time: str, duration: int):
    # Atomic transaction
    cursor.execute('INSERT INTO appointments ...')
    cursor.execute('UPDATE doctor_schedules SET is_available = 0 ...')
    conn.commit()
```

#### Challenge 3: Multi-channel Communication Coordination

**Problem**: Coordinating email and SMS delivery with proper timing
**Solution**:
- Centralized communication service
- Queue-based reminder system
- Status tracking for delivery confirmation

**Implementation**:
```python
class ReminderScheduler:
    def schedule_reminder(self, appointment_id: str, reminder_type: str, 
                         scheduled_time: str):
        # Schedule email and SMS reminders
        # Track delivery status
```

#### Challenge 4: Scalable Agent Architecture

**Problem**: Managing complex multi-agent workflows without tight coupling
**Solution**:
- LangGraph workflow definition
- Agent-specific responsibilities
- State-based communication

**Implementation**:
```python
workflow = StateGraph(AppointmentState)
workflow.add_node("greeting", self._greeting_node)
workflow.add_node("patient_lookup", self._lookup_node)
# ... additional nodes
```
